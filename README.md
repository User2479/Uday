- 👋 Hi, I’m Uday, have recently graduated from **Plaksha Univeristy** in a postgraduate program(Technology Leaders Program) in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. 
- 👀 I’m interested in **learning by doing things**. Yes, I feel I haven't learnt anything, but just got to know some bits of information whenever I read/listen new concepts.
      Therefore, I reconstruct the concepts explained in the lectures/papers so that I have **clear and solid fundamentals**. However, due to this I have to cleared a lot of my 
      doubts through this process which involved some time, but didn't block my time whenever I encountered similar problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **artificial intelligence/machine learning applications in real world** and understanding its **impact** in real world and what other problems 
      arise/will arrive due to this and how to tackle them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other machine learning engineers, data scientists, and many other people interested in similar probelms I deal with.
- 📫 You could reach me out either on my email: udayss1305@gmail.com, otherwise on LinkedIn: https://in.linkedin.com/in/udaya-bhaskar-vaddi-95685b17a
